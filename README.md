# PasswordBasedSmartDoorLock

Application Development using ARM Cortex M micro-controller in Embedded C and LPC1768 Kit

This project focuses on creating a secure door lock system using a microcontroller, numeric keypad, stepper motor, and LCD display.
The microcontroller manages user-entered passwords, validating them against a preset password, and controls the stepper motor for locking/unlocking. 
The LCD display shows the lock status. This efficient solution meets the demand for secure access control in homes, offices, and other areas, overcoming 
the limitations of traditional lock systems. By simplifying the design and utilizing the microcontroller's capabilities, the project provides a user-friendly, 
cost-effective, and secure solution for access control.
